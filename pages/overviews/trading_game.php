        <h1>Trading Game API</h1>
        <p>This is an API I wrote to handle the basics of a simple trading game. The fictitious front end of the game would utilize this API to faciliate all the necessary actions required to communicate with and update the server.</p>
        <p>Navigating to the project page will give you a summary of available requests, an input field to enter requests into, and a display box for showing response data from the API.</p>
        <p>The project page itself is quick and dirty, simply to provide an easily accessible portal for tinkering with the API I've created. It uses Ajax requests to submit data to a handler php file, which dispatches the requests to the API.</p>
        <p>Technologies: PHP, SQLite</p>
