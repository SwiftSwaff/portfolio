        <h1>Countdown</h1>
        <p>This is a little application that counts down until Canada Day. Most similar little websites use days like Christmas and New Years as their countdown end, and as I was searching for background splash images to use, I happened to come across an aesthetically pleasing one that inspired me.</p>
        <p>Languages: HTML5, CSS3 (with Sass), JavaScript</p>
