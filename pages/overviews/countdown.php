        <h1>Countdown</h1>
        <p>This is a little application that counts down until Canada Day. Most similar little websites use days like Christmas and New Years as their countdown end, and as I was searching for background splash images to use, I happened to come across an aesthetically pleasing one that inspired me.</p>
        <p>If you check the site out on Canada Day, you'll be treated to a white and red flashing overlay that lasts until the next day! Exciting right?</p>
        <p>Technologies: JavaScript, HTML5, CSS3 (with SASS)</p>
