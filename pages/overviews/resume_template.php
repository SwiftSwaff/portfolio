        <h1>Resume Template</h1>
        <p>Recently, I decided that I wanted to give my resume a much needed facelift. Rather than turn to the template generators online, I decided it would be a good exercise to create my own using HTML and CSS!</p>
        <p>Overall I'm very happy with how it turned out. Hilariously enough, this took less time than fighting a Word document would have.</p>
        <p>One of my friends even wanted his resume formatted with this template - I was happy to oblige, though it would have been easier if he could enter his data himself. Perhaps this will be the next step for this project when I have time to implement it.</p>
        <p>Technologies: HTML5, CSS3 (with SASS)</p>
