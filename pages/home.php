        <p>I am a Software Developer that specializes in full-stack technologies. I can bring the vision of a web designer to life with relentless precision then put the result on display for the world to see. I am passionate about empowering users with applications that they deserve - improving the quality of their day-to-day lives.</p>
        <p>I am fluent in PHP, HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and MySQL. With these skills as my foundation, I am able to translate my expertise to a wide spectrum of available langauges and frameworks. I am well versed in object-oriented design and data structures, with an insatiable need to optimize and improve on existing code whenever I get the chance. </p>
        <p>Outside of programming, I am an avid gamer (both physical and digital). I enjoy games that offer a challenge and support social experiences that promote cooperation. I am also a dedicated American football enthusiast (Go Seahawks) and music junkie, with taste once described by a university peer as "music whiplash" - Take that as you will.</p>
        <p>As you may have guessed looking at the banner, I think snakes are pretty awesome (when they aren't trying to kill you). I believe cats and dogs make for better pets, and I wish I weren't allergic to the former.</p>
        <p>Whether you're checking out my portfolio because you wanted a demonstration of my expertise, were curious what comes up when you put swiftswaff.com into a search engine, or because I asked you to check it out, I appreciate you stopping by and taking a look at what I have to offer. :) </p>
